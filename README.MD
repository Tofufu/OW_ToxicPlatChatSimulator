## OW_ToxicPlatChatSimulator
Something I made for fun..... 
Both the discord bot and the static web page generate a random line.
Neither of them take in the user input to evaluate any logic :) . RNG Toxic Generator I suppose.

**RandomNum_DiscordBot:**
* Discord bot that replies with from !platchat command with a random line in hero.json
* To Use: Need to have [discord.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js) installed / config.json edited with discord bot key / index.js = entry point

**RandomNum_Webpage**
* Web page that replies back with a random line (Same as the discord bot but this is just a static browser version) 
* To Use: Open p.html on any browser
